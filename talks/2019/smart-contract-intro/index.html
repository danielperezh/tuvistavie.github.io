# Long Before Smart Contracts
## Bitcoin Scripting

# Bitcoin Scripting

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Bitcoin uses a scripting language
  * Stack-based
  * Control flow (if)
  * Not Turing-complete (no loop)
* Mostly used to define how to spend Bitcoins
* Transaction is invalid if script fails
]
]

.pull-right-50[

# Bitcoin Scripting and UTXO

.pull-left-50[
* Bitcoin follows an UTXO model
* Bitcoin uses "redeem scripts" to enable scripting with UTXO
  * Only a hash of the script is published beforehand
  * Full scripts are published when spending
]

# Flow of a Bitcoin redeem script

1. Write script
2. Hash script to create address
3. Receive Bitcoins
4. Publish script and required data (usually signature) using a transaction

---

# From Bitcoin Scripting to Smart Contracts

We need more features to write general programs

* Persistent state  
  &rarr; account-based  
  &rarr; storage primitives
* Turing-completeness (loops)  
  &rarr; jump primitive
* More transparency?  
  &rarr; code deployed before usage

# Smart Contracts

.pull-left-50[
* Programs deployed on a blockchain
* Usually written in a high-level language and compiled into bytecode
* Interacted with using transactions
* Uses some metering mechanism
]

# What can/cannot Smart Contracts do?

## Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

## Cannot

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically

---

# Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address

---

# How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcasted in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A

---

# A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result

---

# Ethereum Virtual Machine

---

# Ethereum Virtual Machine overview

.tight-list[
* Stack-based virtual machine
* Very low-level
  * No functions/block, only jumps
  * No types
* Has regular VM instructions
  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `PUSH`, `POP`
* Has instructions to interact with environment
  * `SENDER`, `CALL`, `BALANCE`
* Has both ephemeral and permanent storage
* Uses 256-bits words
]

---

# EVM Bytecode

.small-margin[
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

.text.minor[will look something like]

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory (loop counter)
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```

# Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

---

# Gas computation

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

---

# Gas computation: special cases

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

---

# Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned

---

# Solidity

.pull-left-40[
* High-level language targeting the EVM

* Looks vaguely like JavaScript

* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system

* Contains smart contract related primitives
]

.pull-right-60[
```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# Smart Contracts: What could go wrong?

.pull-left-50[
## TheDAO hack (2016)

.spaced-list[
* TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO*
* Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M*
* Price of Ether halved
* Ethereum community decided to hard-fork
* Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability
]
]

.pull-left-50[
## Parity Wallet bug (2017)

.spaced-list[
* Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts
* Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug"
* *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds
* Around *$280M frozen*
]
]

---

# Common vulnerabilities / bugs

.spaced-list[
* Re-entrancy
  * Can allow an attacker to drain funds
* Unhandled exceptions
  * Can result in lost funds
* Dependency on destructed contract
  * Can result in locked funds
* Transaction order dependency
  * Can allow an attacker to manipulate prices
* Integer overflow
  * Can result in locked fund
]

---

# Re-entrancy

.pull-left-50[
* Vulnerable contract sends money before updating state

* Attacker contract’s fallback function is called

* Attacker contract makes re-entrant call to attacker
]


.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function payMe(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  // XXX: vulnerable
  if (!account.send(amount))
    throw;
  balance[account] -= amount;
}
```

```solidity
function () {
  victim.payMe(owner);
}
```
.caption[

]

]

---

# Unhandled exception

.pull-left-50[
* In Solidity, not all failed "calls" raise an exception

* If the failed call returns a boolean, it must be checked correctly

* Failure to do this could result in inconsistent state or even locked funds
]

.pull-right-50[
.middle-block[
```solidity
// allows user to withdraw funds
function withdraw(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  balance[account] -= amount;
  account.send(amount); // could silently fail
}
```
.caption[

]
]

---

# Dependency on destructed contract

.pull-left-40[
* Contracts can use other contracts as library

* If the library contract gets destructed, the call becomes a no-op

* If the only way for a contract to send money is to use the library,
Ether can be locked
]


.pull-right-60[
```solidity
function sendEther(address recipient,
                   uint value) public onlyOwner {
  address.send(value)
}
```

```solidity
address public library = 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470;
function sendEther(address recipient, uint value) public {
  bytes4 sig =  bytes4(sha3("sendEther(address, uint)"));
  library.delegatecall(sig, recipient, value);
}
```
.caption[

---

# Transaction Order Dependency

.pull-left-50[
* Result can change depending on the order of the transactions

* Miners are free to choose the miner order of the transactions in a block

* There can be financial incentives to perform such manipulations
]

.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function solve() {
  if (msg.sender == owner) {// update reward
    owner.send(reward);
    reward = msg.value;
  } else if (puzzleSolved(msg.data)) {
    msg.sender.send(reward); //send reward
    solution = msg.data;
  }
}
```

# Integer Overflow

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Solidity has many different numeric types
  * `int8` to `int256` and `uint8` to `uint256`
* Types are encoded in EVM using bit manipulations
  * If `a` is `uint8`, a `AND a 0xff` would be generated
* Variables may therefore overflow or underflow during execution
]
]

.pull-right-50[
.middle-block[
```solidity
function overflow(uint fee) {
  uint amount = 100;

  // underflows if fee > 100
  amount -= fee;

  // tries to send a large value
  // and fails on underflow
  msg.sender.send(amount);
}
```

# Smart Contract exploitation

.pull-left-50[
## According to analysis tools

* Thousands of vulnerable contracts

* Hundreds of millions USD at risk
]

.pull-right-50[
## In the real-world

* TheDAO and Parity wallet bug were impressive

* Otherwise, a few attacks here and there

# Takeaways and conclusions

---

# Takeaways

* **Re-entrancy** seems to be the *most dangerous* issue. Good target for static analysis. Better prevention at the EVM level could be helpful.

* **Unhandled exceptions** are *handled well enough* by current tooling.

* **Dependency on destructed contract** is mostly a *non-issue*.

* **Transactions order dependency** seems to be *very rare* in practice

* **Integer overflow** is hard to prevent and consequences *hard to predict*. Also good target for static analysis.

# Contracts wealth distribution

.pull-left-50[
* Combined value: *~2 million ETH*

* Only *~2,000* out of 21,270 contracts *held Ether*

* Less than 100 contracts had more than 10 Ether

* The *top 6 contracts held 83%* of the total Ether

# Vulnerable but not exploitable

.pull-left-50[
* Many cases where "vulnerable" contracts are not exploitable

* High-value contracts flagged vulnerable are typically not exploitable

* Usually limitation due to the nature of static analysis

# Summary

* Analyzed 21k contracts with *3M Ether at risk*

* *At most 0.3%* of this Ether, less than 10k ETH, was *exploited*

* Overall, *high-value contracts* seem to be quite *secure*
